1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 e6 4. Nf3 a6 {There are many games played with d5
also.} 5. Qe2 {This move prevents d5 and indicates a closed game with a slow
build up for White on the kingside while black tries to find queenside
counterplay.} Be7 6. d3 d5 7. g3 Nf6 8. e5 Nd7 (8... Ng8 $5 {I considered Ng8
so this knight can try to find a home on f5 or go to d4. In that case I can
exchange this piece which is a bit clumsy on the queenside as it gets in the
way of my pieces.} 9. Bg2 Nh6 10. Nd1 Nf5 11. Ne3 Nfd4 12. Qd1 Nxf3+ 13. Bxf3)

14. Nd1 Qc7 15. c3 d4 {This may have been too soon. I did not want to allow
white to play d4, but I could have waited to play d4 by developing my king's
rook and threatening the h6 pawn with Bf8 and possibly Ne7-f5.} (15... Rfd8 16.

it prevents my c6 knight regrouping to f5 or d5 through e7.} Ne7 $2 (21... Na5

This gives my king some breathing room and then I am ready to exchange light
squared bishops and bring my knight to b7.} 23. Rd2 Bxg2 24. Qxg2 Nb7 25. b3
