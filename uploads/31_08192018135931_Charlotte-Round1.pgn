1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 d5 3. Bg2 e6 4. d4 {This was a tricky move order. I planned
to meet c4 with Bb4+ Bd2 followed by Be7 to prevent white from the Qc2 Nbd2 e4
plan I discussed in Video 1. But by delaying c4, Bb4+ makes less sense because
of c3.} c5 5. O-O Be7 (5... cxd4 6. Nxd4 e5 {This fits my style a bit more,
but there is nothing wrong with the move played. I just didn't know the theory
and ended up spending way too much time in the opening.}) 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. c4
O-O 8. cxd5 exd5 9. Bg5 Be6 10. Nc3 Nbd7 (10... Nc6 11. Bxf6 Qxf6 12. Nxd5 Qxb2
13. Nc7 Rad8 14. Qc1 Qxc1 15. Raxc1 b6 16. Nxe6 fxe6) 11. Rc1 Rc8 12. Nd4 h6
13. Bf4 Nb6 {I had spent over an hour for the opening and was not familiar
with the ideas in the position.} (13... a6 14. Nxe6 fxe6 15. e4 (15. Bh3 Qe7)
15... e5 16. Bd2 d4 17. Ne2) 14. b3 Bg4 $2 {When I played this move during the
game I thought my position was improving. Ideas like Re8-Qd7 were natural
moves to complete my development, but I missed white's idea.} 15. Ncb5 $1 Na8 (
15... a6 16. Na7) (15... Qe7 16. Rxc5 Qxc5 17. Bd6) 16. h3 Bh5 {Trying to keep
pressure on e2. I knew Nf5 is an idea now and my c8 rook is undefended so I
would have to trade my dark square bishop for the knight. Be6 may have been
the best move, just admitting my mistake of Bg4.} 17. Nd6 $1 Bxd6 18. Rxc8 Qxc8
19. Bxd6 Re8 20. Ba3 (20. Bb4 {To cover c3.}) 20... Qc3 $1 {Preventing Bb2 and
putting pressure on d4 so the queen is tied down.} 21. g4 Bg6 22. e3 Nb6 23.
Qc1 Qa5 24. Bb2 Rc8 25. Qa1 Nbd7 {My original ideas in the opening cost me a
lot of time. Nb6 and Bg4 were not the best...} 26. Rd1 Qd8 {I wanted to play
h5 and attack the weakened kingside when my queen is ready to come into play,
but I did not want to do it too soon as g7 will be attacked.} 27. Ne2 Rc2 28.
Nf4 Be4 29. Nxd5 $5 {Something didn't feel right about this move, but I had
less than 1 min to sort it out so I played the safest line to get a small
initiative, but I missed the best move.} (29. Rc1 {White needs to try to
remove or trade this pesky rook.}) 29... Bxd5 (29... Nxg4 $1 30. hxg4 (30. Bxe4
Qh4 $19) (30. Bxg7 Qh4 31. Ne7+ Qxe7 $19) (30. Rc1 Bxg2 31. Rxc2 Bxd5 32. hxg4

Nxd5 36. Rxd5 Rxd5 37. exd5 f6 38. Qf5 $11) 30... Nxd5 31. Rxd5 Qh4 32. Qf1 {
I felt like my opponent did not see this position when she went for Nxd5, but
everything seemed to work out for white, but I think black is slightly better
now.} Rxb2 (32... Nb6 33. Rh5 $14) (32... Nc5 $1 33. Rh5 Qd8 34. Bd4 Ne6 {
The knight c5-e6 manuever looks strong covering e6 and finally reaching a good
post after once upon a time being on a8. The position is equal but blacks
pieces look slightly more coordinated.}) 33. Rxd7 h5 34. gxh5 Rxa2 35. Rxb7
Qxh5 $2 {Time trouble...I was about to play Ra5 but I wanted to keep pressure
on f2, but this was the losing mistake.} (35... Qg5+ 36. Qg2 (36. Kh1 Qd5+ 37.
Qg2 Qd1+ 38. Qg1 Qf3+ 39. Qg2 Rxf2 40. Qxf3 Rxf3 41. Rxa7 Rxe3 $11) 36... Ra1+
37. Kh2 Qe5+ 38. Qg3 Qe4 39. Rb8+ Kh7 40. Qg2 Qe5+ 41. Qg3 $11) 36. Qb1 $1 {
This move order threatens Rb8 checkmate and my rook on a2. I did not see the
proper response and I quickly get into a lost rook and pawn endgame.} Qg6+ $2 {
In time trouble I missed Qg5+ followed by Rd2 to return with Rd8 and cover the
bank rank.} (36... Qg5+ $1 37. Kf1 Rd2 38. Qe4 Rd1+ 39. Ke2 Qh5+ 40. Qg4 Qa5

Rg4 Rh1 58. f4 Rxh3 59. e5 Kf3 60. e6 Rh5+ 61. Rg5 Rh4 62. e7 Rxf4+ 63. Ke6 {
I spent too much time in the opening of this game and did not have time to
think in the crucial positions resulting later on. My opponent played quickly
in the opening and went for all the sharp lines and it paid off. Ncb5, Nxd5
and Qb1 were all the sharp moves in the position and I did not deal with Qb1
properly, but overall I thought I played well. Time management was the main
problem.} 1-0
